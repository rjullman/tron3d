This is the beginning of a 3d tron lightbikes game.  The game was created as a project in our [college graphics class](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr14/cos426/syllabus.php).  The game was created in a short time and is not a polished product.  Regardless, it was an fun exploration into using 3d libraries.
